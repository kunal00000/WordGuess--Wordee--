## Guess the Wordee in 6 tries.

**Wordee** is a word guessing. The game is built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

The game consists of a randomly generated word and the player has to guess the word by inputting letters. The game also has a feature that keeps track of the number of incorrect guesses the player has made. The game ends either when the player successfully guesses the word or when the number of incorrect guesses reaches a certain limit.

* The color of the tiles will change to show how close your guess was to the word.
